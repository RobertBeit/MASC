To send eth first click on connect wallet to connect to metamask.  Then enter the address of which you wish to send eth to.  Additionally fill in the key word and message parts of the form.

Recent transactions are listed on the lower part of the page.  The first 6 results initially are dummy data until users start sending transactions on the live site.
